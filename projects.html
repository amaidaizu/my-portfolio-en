        <u>Coding languages and softwares:</u> HTML, CSS and Krita for picture editing, coded on Phoenix Code<br>
        <u>Realization time:</u> 6h<br>
        <u>Realization date:</u> 2025<br><br>
        <u>Pictures:</u> Photo of a copyright-free restaurant, Italian flag<br>
        <u>Fonts:</u> DM Serif Display et Windsong, for a more sophisticated look, on Google Fonts<br>
        <u>Color palettes:</u> Italian flag's green (red would create too much contrast), beige color to make the vintage menu stand out<br>
        <u>Interactive elements:</u> Drop-down menu<br><br>
        <u>Problems encountered:</u> I struggled to make white columns appear on the sides. After research, I could center the text's body.<br><br>
        <u>What I like:</u> I am satisfied about the fonts I chose, that seemed refined, especially, "Winsong". I also like the separation with the flag at the bottom of the page.<br>
        <u>To go further:</u> Apart from my satisfcation of the outcome, a better adaptability on different platforms (tablet, phone) would be preferable.<br>
        A more functional drop-down menu would be better too, despite my modifications and researches, it did not fuction as I wanted it to.

        <u>Realization time:</u> 5h<br>
        <u>Realization date:</u> 2024<br><br>
        <u>Fonts:</u> Iceland and Jacquard 12 on Google Fonts<br>
        <u>Pictures:</u> Personal photo<br>
        <u>Color palettes:</u> Black and dark blue, for a dark and futuristic effect, more personal<br>
        <u>Interactive elements:</u> Different interactives buttons, video integration<br><br>
        <u>Problems encountered:</u> One of the first sites I coded and so I had to do a lot of researches for the visual layout. I had a hard time enclosing the containers. After other researches, I also succeeded in separating the video and its background from the text's body.<br>
        <u>What I like:</u> I really like the dark ambiance that this site creates. This font is one of my favories in Google Fonts.<br>
        <u>To go further:</u> On a more personal note, and in hindsight, I would suggest a better YouTube video resizing. It is also quite simple, more elements such as a part dedicated to fake (of course) merch could be imagined.<br>

      <p style="text-align: center;">
        <u>Softwares:</u> InDesign<br>
        <u>Realization time:</u> 4h<br>
        <u>Realization date:</u> 2023<br><br>
        <u>Type of drawing:</u> Vectorial<br>
        <u>Color palettes:</u> Dark blue and light blue<br><br>
        <u>Project:</u> This poster was created for a contest launched by "Médecins du Monde", fighting against the housing crisis. Our high-school therefore participated in it and we could have realized this poster.<br>
        <u>Constraints:</u> We had to observe an imposed color palette, a specific format and fonts within the framework of the contest.<br>
        <u>What I liked:</u> I really like the tagline and I find the vectorial drawing very impacting: one directly gets it.<br>
        <u>Problems encountered:</u> Manipulating the vectorial drawing was a bit complicated. After getting help from the teachers and from my own attempts and researches, I finally achieved the shapes I wanted to.<br>
        <u>To go further:</u> I am content with the poster, but the shadow of the person does not cover the drawn circle on the ground enough, which makes it overrun in the bottom-right.<br>

        <u>Softwares:</u> CapCut<br>
        <u>Realization time:</u> 4h<br>
        <u>Realization date:</u> 2022<br><br>
        <u>Synopsis:</u> A girl walks around in her schoolyard when suddenly, a box falls from the sky.
          She opens it and it containes a pen that she puts in her pocket. Once in class, throughout a dictation, she finds out that the pen realizes what she writes during the dictation.
          Surprised and back home, probably submerged by her homework, she writes that she does not want some anymore and her friends inform her right away that there is no more for the following day.
          One day, as she drops her pen in the schoolyard when wanting to pull out her phone, someone walks over it. Panicked, she picks up the pen, rushes to try it but nothing of what she writes realizes itself. It does not work anymore.<br><br>
        <u>Project:</u> This video was realized as part of a workshop with a panelist working in the video field. The goal was to imagine, by groups of 5, a scenario, a storyboard, to shoot a short film on the theme of surnatural. My work in this group project was to play in this video, as well as editing it on CapCut.<br>
        <u>Contraints:</u> We had to realize all of this in 4 hours.<br>
        <u>What I liked:</u> I was not used to play in a short film, which was my first time. However, the editing was something I was already familiar with and that I like very much. With this result, we were proud of us.<br>
        <u>Encountered problems:</u> Our opinions quite differed regarding the scenario. We had to agree to choose a story we all liked. Especially in this very limited time frame, our organization had to be very meticulous.<br>
        <u>To go further:</u> We took inspiration in an already existing manga and anime work for the story. Maybe could we have other ideas or bring together every idea we had?
